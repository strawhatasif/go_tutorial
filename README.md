# Go tutorial
## Following a structured Golang tutorial
* ### https://tour.golang.org/

## Getting started
* ### I would recommend checking out https://golang.org/doc/install for installation and setup

## IDE
* ### I prefer `Visual Studio Code` - they provide excellent support for Golang. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go

## How do you run these programs?
* ### I prefer running these within a terminal using this command `go run .\name_of_program.go`
* ### Example: `go run .\fun_fun_functions.go`
